Over the past few years I have noticed a few things when it came to the tech community, and that was that the majority of developers/engineers I worked alongside enjoyed playing video games in their free time. This is something that is often
associated with developers and those in this community, but I always wondered why it was. This blog post is going to look at some of my own theories as to why this may be (as a side note all of these opinions are my own and therefore may very much be wrong).

# Nature vs Nurture?

The common argument for this is that people in tech are in tech because they were around video games as kids. And in many cases this is true - many of my friends in tech have stated at one point or another that their start in the world of tech 
was through playing video games. They would play games in their free time as kids and as they grew older and had to make decisions about their future they had to think about what they enjoyed and games/technology was a big component of that.

I think that this argument holds value for many people, but I don't believe that is the only thing that has pushed people down the path of technology. For one, I know plenty of people who only started getting into gaming after they got into the tech
community and some who still haven't picked up a controller or downloaded steam. Both of which are entirely acceptable, playing games is not, and should not be a compulsory component towards becoming a developer as much as I believe it can help.

# Game Mechanics

I recently watched a video from a person who had their partner play games, their partner was not a gamer by any means and for the most part had never played games in the past. The "Informal Experiment" as they put it was to see how their partner 
picked up and learn games/game mechanics and this was the part that caught my eye - because I began to identify many similarities between how people learn games and how they learn software. For instance, games are not learnt individually for the
most part - especially as a beginner. Whether you are completing a tutorial, watching a video or playing with a sibling there is some other force that guides you towards the objective or purpose. The same is true for software - often when you are 
starting out with code you have no clue what the objective is or even how to get there, so you watch videos on YT or ask a friend with experience. 

These simple actions (or what seem like simple actions), are actually how we learn in general. Through other people we can pick up the essential skills and knowledge required to complete a task. But I don't think that this is the most important task, 
that I believe comes from the type of person you have to be/become to play games. And that has to do with how games are themselves, for the most part they are structured around a reward system - whether that's finishing a level or completing a particularly 
difficult task they are often difficult to the point of frustration until you achieve the desired goal then they elation from achieving this is so much that you continue. It takes a specific type of person to endlessly stare at a screen getting more and more 
frustrated until they finally reach the goal that were seeking. And those people are very well adapted for software engineering.

# Final Thoughts

All in I think that this is in fact a case in which it is a combination of the two arguments and that whilst game mechanics are playing a large part in the training for problem-solving and resilience they are by no means the only way of achieving this - 
similar to the fact that having that exposure to games is helpful in growth in that area but is not necessary to move towards tech and that job path.
