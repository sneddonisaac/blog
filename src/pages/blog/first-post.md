Welcome to the first post on the blog.

# Why Astro?

I have been wanting to test out a variety of frameworks recently, namely svelte and astro for their claims of better web performance have enchanted me. I have also wanted to build a blog to 
write out many of my projects in a more written format (not that I think anyone will ever read these, but it is a good way for me to look at how I worked years previous.)

With that I set out to start my blog and when it came to choosing what web framework to test it out on there was (as many dev learn), an incredible amount of frameworks to choose from!

From the heavy JS based path of React to the lightweight, fast side with Qwik and vanilla html/js. The choices can often confuse developers myself included, with the paradox of choice causing 
decision fatigue and additional stress when decisions could and should be simple. 

That being said it is always fun and good to try something new.

**The Choices:**

### Astro

Astro has been building popularity over the past few years in its rise to v1. It has been built as a way to build fast, content-driven websites - something that a blog very much is.
To that end I chose this framework for its speed, accessibility and to test those rumour build/page speeds!


### Svelte
